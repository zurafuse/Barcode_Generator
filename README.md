# Barcode Generator
A simple 3of9 Barcode generator made with Python via the Turtle class. This is a mini project made for a Udacity Python course.

## How to Get Started

Download the Barcode Generator project. Unzip it and place "barcode.py" into a folder on your desktop where you keep your Python files. Open the file with Python and run it. The file contains dictionaries of the 3of9 barcode patterns for each numeric and each letter in the English language, and it writes out a barcode entry for each character the user inputs. 3of9 barcodes are composed of four different displays: a thick line, a thin line, a small space, and a large space.

## How to Use the Barcode generator

Enter text (letters and numbers only), up to 10 characters. The program will then write out our input as a 3of9 barcode.
